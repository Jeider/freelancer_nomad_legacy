    Here you can set your intended game resolution. The game's actual
    resolution doesn't need to match it, it's only used to scale the text areas
    defined in this file. The DPI setting is used for font size scaling.

    In this section you can set up the three text areas that appear.
    You have to set up each of Debug, Cinematic, and Ingame; custom text
    areas are not implemented yet.
    * Each text area can be disabled individually using the Enabled
      attribute - you'll likely want to disable Debug. If you don't set Enabled,
      it defaults to true.
    * Setting a text area to Direct uses a different method for rendering
      subtitles, essentially a workaround. For best results, enable direct mode
      on Cinematic and disable it on Ingame. If you don't set it, it defaults
      to false. Direct text areas can't be transparent and use more CPU, but
      they are also more reliable.
    * X, Y, Width, and Height describe where to put the subtitle box,
      in (scaled) pixels.
    
    You also need to assign a font to each text area.
    The attributes you can change:
    * Size: The size of the text, in points.
    * Family: The font family to be used. Freelancer's native font family
      is called Agency FB.
    * Alignment: Where to put text within a line.
      Possible values are Leading, Trailing, Center, and Justified.
      It is recommended to leading-align the Ingame text area, because certain
      spoken lines are assembled on-the-fly by the game. Setting it to anything
      else would cause existing text to jump around as new words are added.
      The default alignment is Leading.
