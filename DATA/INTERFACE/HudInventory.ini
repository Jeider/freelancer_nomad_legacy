; EXAMPLES

;Sabre originally was upper a bit off the center. Adjusting center.
ship = SHIPS\BORDER_WORLD\BW_VHEAVY_FIGHTER\bw_vheavy_fighter.cmp, center, 0, 4, 0

;Rheiland battleship was upper a bit  off the center. Adjusting center.
ship = SHIPS\RHEINLAND\RH_BATTLESHIP\rh_battleship.cmp, center, 0, -70, 0

;Rheinland gunboat had problems with interactions. Increasing radius.
ship = SHIPS\RHEINLAND\RH_GUNSHIP\rh_gunship.cmp, radius, 80

;Osiris was too close to the screen therefore its roof could be seen only. 
;Pushing it backwards and upper a bit to get it straight in the center. 
;Increasing radius to be able interact with mounted equipment, which will be scaled-up on 80+ sized ships.
ship = SHIPS\ORDER\OR_OSIRIS\or_osiris.cmp, center, 0, -325, -15, radius, 350
