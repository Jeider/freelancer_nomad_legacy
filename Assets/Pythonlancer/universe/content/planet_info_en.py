The atmosphere is virtually absent, making any landing on the surface possible only in fully sealed suits. The only activity is an automated station in polar orbit, engaged in mapping the ice sheets.''',
    '''An icy dwarf giant with a turbulent, poisonous atmosphere of methane and ammonia, where perpetual storms rage. Beneath the cloud layer lies not a solid surface, but an endless ocean of super-dense "hot ice". A ring system of ice dust serves as a source of raw materials for the nearby processing station "Glacis". The planet itself is inaccessible.''',
    '''An abandoned ice sphere with signs of past mining. The surface is scarred with quarries and abandoned machinery, forever frozen into the ice. The atmosphere is extremely thin.

The station in orbit is uninhabited and partially looted.''',
    '''A planet captured by the tidal forces of a gas giant, leading to extreme cryovolcanism. Its surface is constantly renewed by eruptions of liquid water and slag, which instantly freeze into bizarre shapes. The orbital science station "Thermos" studies this unique geological process, but landing is considered too risky due to seismic instability.''',

The surface consists of layers of regular and dry ice (frozen CO2). Expeditions are periodically sent to the planet to mine rare isotopes that concentrate in ice cores.''',
    '''A planet with an extreme axial tilt, creating seasons lasting decades. During the "summer" period, some of the ice sublimates, forming a temporary thin atmosphere and exposing primitive bedrock. During the "winter" period, everything freezes over again. A seasonal station operates in orbit to study this cycle.''',
    '''An ice planet in the process of gravitational disintegration. Its core has cooled, and it is slowly being torn apart, forming a giant system of icy debris that will one day become a ring. Landing is impossible due to monstrous seismic activity and gas venting from fissures. Scientists observe the process from a safe distance.''',
    '''Deep freeze. The surface temperature is close to absolute zero. The atmosphere has frozen out and settled as exotic ices on the dark side. The planet is of interest to physicists studying quantum effects under such conditions.''',

The planet is patrolled by military vessels; landing on the surface is strictly prohibited for private individuals.'''

    '''"Ice Trap". A planet with an extremely thin atmosphere, almost entirely composed of frozen gases settled on the surface. The ice here forms not a cover, but a complex, crystal lattice-like structure with giant internal voids. Falling into such a crevasse means certain death—escaping from the labyrinth of smooth ice walls without external help is impossible.''',
    '''"Ocean Under Ice". A smooth, glass-like ice sheet tens of kilometers thick hides a global saline ocean beneath. Ground-penetrating radars detect complex currents and even signs of primitive life within, but breaching the ice with modern means is impossible. The surface has not a speck of dust, only an endless mirror plain reflecting the stars.''',
    '''"Iceberg Planet". A planet almost devoid of heavy elements. 99% of its mass consists of various phases of water ice formed under pressure. The surface is scarred by deep blue fissures extending hundreds of kilometers inward. Due to low density, the gravitational field is weak and "spongy," complicating orbital maneuvers.''',
    '''"Snow Globe". A planet with an active but cold atmosphere, where instead of rain, eternal snow of ammonia and methane crystals falls.

There is almost no wind; snow falls vertically in absolute silence.''',
    '''"Glacial Slab". The surface is a single, monolithic slab of exotic ice-VII, formed under monstrous pressure in the interior. It is perfectly smooth, without craters or irregularities, like a billiard ball. The atmosphere has frozen out and lies on the surface as a thin frost. Temperature is near absolute zero.''',
    '''"Cryovolcanic Nightmare". The planet is geologically active, but its volcanoes erupt not lava, but superheated water, ammonia, and methane.

The surface is unstable.''',
    '''"Striped Ice". Alternating epochs of different substance deposition have created a clear layered structure on the planet, visible on cliffs. Dark bands of carbon compounds alternate with white layers of pure water ice and bluish strata of frozen oxygen. There is no atmosphere; the process stopped millions of years ago.''',
    '''"Ice Desert". An endless plain of granular water ice (firn), resembling coarse sugar. It does not fuse into a monolith but behaves like a granular material, forming white "sand" dunes under weak winds. The sky is always veiled in white haze from icy suspension. Temperatures are consistently low but not extreme.''',
    '''"Frozen Ocean World". In the past, this was a water planet that froze completely to the core. Now it is a ball of ice of different phases: from ordinary ice-I on the surface to exotic superionic and metallic forms in the center. The surface is covered with bizarre outgrowths—former icebergs frozen into the general mass.''',
    '''"Ablation Plain". The planet is on an elongated orbit, and periodic approach to the star causes ice sublimation from the surface. This has created smooth, polished plateaus and terraces. An atmosphere, consisting of evaporated gases, appears only briefly during perihelion, only to freeze out again.''',
    '''"Ice Chaos". The surface is a jumble of giant ice blocks, debris, and pressure ridges, as if the planet was blown apart from within and then frozen. Between the blocks are deep chasms. The atmosphere is thin. Gravitational anomalies indicate uneven mass distribution, possibly due to huge subglacial cavities.''',
    '''"Dry Ice World". Temperature and pressure allow carbon dioxide to exist on the surface in solid phase (dry ice). It forms extensive smooth fields that periodically sublimate, creating a seasonal, barely perceptible atmosphere. Beneath a thin crust of dry ice lies a layer of ordinary water ice.''',
    '''"Ice Rings". The planet possesses a system of giant concentric ice ridges encircling it like annual rings on a tree stump. They formed due to cyclical changes in orbital parameters and tidal forces. Between the ridges lie flat, snow-covered valleys. The atmosphere is practically absent.''',
    '''"Cryocones". The landscape is dotted with thousands of regular cone-shaped hills of dense ice hundreds of meters high—the result of deep fluid vents that froze, forming these structures. They are covered with a thin patterned crust of frozen gases. There is no wind; a tomb-like silence prevails.''',
    '''"Ice Mirror". A perfectly smooth, wind-polished (the winds have long since ceased) surface of transparent ice. Beneath a thin top layer lies a multi-kilometer thickness of absolutely pure, inclusion-free water ice. It acts as a lens, focusing and distorting the light of distant stars, creating bizarre light patterns on the surface. There is no atmosphere.''',

Used only as an astronomical reference point and a gravity assist maneuver point by long-haul truckers.''',
    '''A world of salt deserts. The remnants of a once vast ocean are now giant dried-up basins covered with a crust of salt kilometers thick. The thin atmosphere cannot retain heat, causing extreme diurnal temperature swings. Geological probes indicate deep deposits of chlorides and sulfates, but their extraction is economically unviable.''',
    '''The "Sand Giant" – a planet with a relatively dense but unbreathable nitrogen atmosphere, in which microscopic silica particles float. The winds are moderate but eternal. The surface is an endless, table-flat sea of fine sand, without a single rock or elevation on the horizon. The complete lack of a geomagnetic field makes surface navigation impossible.''',
    '''A desert born of a glacier. The planet's surface is covered not with sand, but with billions of tons of finely ground glacial debris (rock flour), left behind after the evaporation of giant ice sheets. The atmosphere is cold, dry, and thin. Dust storms here resemble moving walls of grey haze. The orbital station notes a complete absence of any organic matter.''',
    '''The planet of iron storms. Its rusty-red color is due not to iron oxide in the sand, but to particles of pure metal dust lifted into the thin atmosphere by powerful electrostatic storms. These storms regularly disable sensitive electronics. Metal deposits are vast but meaningless for mining, as they consist of homogeneous, difficult-to-separate dust.''',
    '''A stone desert. Millions of years of erosion have turned mountain ranges into fields of sharp, wind-smoothed stones – "stone forests". The atmosphere is virtually absent, the sky is always black. Temperature fluctuations cause loud cracking and splitting of rocks. Geological expeditions are sometimes sent here to collect unique core samples but do not stay long.''',
    '''The Glass Plain. The planet's surface is a giant field of volcanic obsidian, formed by a catastrophic eruption in ancient times. It is smooth as a mirror and reflects starlight. The atmosphere is barely detectable. Landing is dangerous due to razor-sharp edges and high static electricity. Orbital scans show nothing but pure silicate glass.''',
    '''The Sponge Planet. Its crust consists of extremely porous, lightweight rock that crumbles into fine dust under the influence of winds and temperature changes. This dust fills the thin atmosphere with a permanent yellowish haze. The ground cannot support the weight of heavy machinery. Any drilling attempt leads to collapse and the equipment being swallowed by the loose rock.''',
    '''A cold desert on the edge of the system. It receives negligible light from its star. The atmosphere of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) lies on the surface as snow. Beneath it is frozen regolith. The world is absolutely static and silent. The only artificial structure is a beacon in geostationary orbit, warning ships of the gravity well.''',

    '''World of the "Dust Mirror". The surface is covered by a layer of microscopic quartz dust hundreds of meters deep, possessing unusual light-reflecting properties. By day it is blindingly bright, by night it cools rapidly, emitting in the infrared. The atmosphere is thinned to the limit, and constant electrostatic discharges lift dust into the air, forming stationary "dust lakes" hanging at an altitude of a kilometer.''',
    '''Desert of "Fractured Basalt". Its foundation is giant plates of solidified lava, fractured by a network of deep canyons. Wind has polished them to a mirror shine over millions of years. The canyon floors are filled with fine-grained sand where any machinery sinks. The atmosphere consists of inert gases with admixtures of volcanic aerosols, toxic in the long term.''',
    '''"Wandering Dunes". A planet with a stable but extremely thin atmosphere. Its feature is giant, almost monolithic sand dunes up to two kilometers high. Under the influence of weak but constant winds, they slowly migrate across the planet at a speed of several meters per year, gradually burying any surface features beneath them.''',
    '''Salt Wasteland. Remnants of an ancient, long-evaporated alkaline ocean. The surface is a continuous crust of chlorides, sulfates, and carbonates, crisscrossed with polygonal cracks. During temperature fluctuations, the crust emits loud clicks and crunches. The atmosphere is chemically inert but contains traces of toxic halogens.''',
    '''Planet of "Stone Flows". The terrain was shaped not by wind, but by periodic liquid ejections from the interior, which quickly solidified, forming bizarre "frozen rivers" and "lava-like" tongues of fused silicate material. Between them are areas of fine, flour-like regolith. There is no water or significant atmosphere.''',
    '''"Sand Ocean". An absolutely flat plain of fine, homogeneous sand stretching to the horizon. No stones, no craters, no elevations. The atmosphere is stable and transparent, with almost no wind. The complete lack of visual landmarks causes spatial disorientation in anyone attempting to move across the surface.''',
    '''World of "Pumice Fields". Light, porous pumice, ejected by ancient supervolcanoes, covers the entire planet in a layer tens of meters thick. It is fragile and turns to dust underfoot. The atmosphere is thin, saturated with this very dust, creating a permanent reddish haze. The ground cannot support weight, making any landing pointless.''',
    '''Cryodesert. Surface temperatures are constantly below the freezing point of carbon dioxide. The "sand" here consists of granules of water ice and frozen gases. Weak winds transport these granules, forming ice dunes. The atmosphere is so thin that the ice sublimates directly into vacuum without melting.''',
    '''"Iron Sands". The surface is covered with iron oxide, not as dust, but in the form of perfectly round microspheres polished by billions of years of collisions. They create unstable, "flowing" ground. The planet's powerful residual magnetic field causes these spheres to align into complex patterns that are destroyed by the slightest movement.''',
    '''Desert of Wind Erosion. A planet with a dense atmosphere and moderate temperatures, but devoid of any moisture. Constant strong winds have, over geological epochs, ground all mountains to dust, leaving only bedrock in the form of isolated, polished-to-a-shine "quartz fangs". The air is saturated with abrasive silicate suspension.''',
    '''Clay Wasteland. The surface is dried, cracked clay forming endless mosaic patterns. Under the slightest pressure, it turns into sticky, caustic dust. The atmosphere contains sulfur compounds that react with the clay, coloring it poisonous yellow and green hues. No solid rock.''',
    '''World of "Sand Lightning". The thin atmosphere is saturated with fine sand, which generates powerful static electricity when moved. As a result, even in a weak wind, silent discharges—"dry lightning"—constantly flash above the surface, creating a dangerous electromagnetic background for any electronics.''',
    '''Gravel Plain. Instead of sand—an endless sea of rounded, polished pebbles ranging from pea to fist size. It is deep and unstable. The atmosphere is practically absent, the sky is always black. Temperature differences between day and night cause the pebbles to shift and settle with a characteristic crackling sound.''',
    '''Planet of "Compacted Dunes". The sand here is not loose, but fused into monolithic forms by an unknown process. Dunes and barchans look like stone sculptures. Between them are areas of ordinary sand. The atmosphere is inert. The compaction process apparently ceased millions of years ago.''',
    '''"White Desert". The surface consists of gypsum and anhydrite ground into a finest, dazzling white powder. It reflects up to 95% of light, creating unbearable brightness. The atmosphere is clean and transparent, winds are rare. This powder penetrates the smallest crevices of mechanisms, disabling them through abrasive action and chemical activity.''',

    '''A giant with a helium imbalance. Its atmosphere has an anomalously low helium content, which, being heavier than hydrogen, sank deep into the planet. This created unusual stratification and led to the formation of extensive, calm regions with reduced turbulence.''',
    '''A giant with cryovolcanic moons. Tidal forces from the planet heat the interiors of its icy moons, causing powerful cryovolcanic eruptions on them. Some of this material (water, ammonia) is captured by the giant's magnetosphere and forms sparse temporary rings or supplements its atmosphere.''',

    '''A giant with a carbon-oxygen cycle. Trace amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide have been detected in its atmosphere. Chemical models suggest the existence of a slow cycle of transformations between different carbon forms, but the mechanism remains unclear.''',
    '''An accreting planet. Its gravitational field constantly captures micrometeorites and cosmic dust from the surrounding space. Upon entering the atmosphere, they burn up, creating a constant weak meteor background. The atmospheric composition gradually enriches with heavy elements.''',
    '''A giant with phase stratification. Different components of its atmosphere condense at different altitudes, creating clearly separated cloud layers. Between the layers exist relatively transparent interlayers where pressure and temperature are outside the condensation points for these substances.''',

    '''A "porous" moon. Its crust has anomalously low density due to numerous voids and lava tubes. The surface is fragile and collapses under minimal load, forming dust "craters". Gravity is so weak that dust takes weeks to settle.''',
    '''A world with remnants of an ancient carbonate atmosphere. Surface formations of limestone and dolomite are preserved - evidence that liquid reservoirs existed here in the distant past under a dense atmosphere long since lost to space.''',
    '''A tidally deformable satellite. Its shape is clearly ellipsoidal - elongated toward the planet. The surface is covered with a grid of parallel cracks from constant gravitational stress. Internal heating is minimal, but structural stresses are enormous.''',
    '''A moon with a metallic core creating a weak but global magnetic field. This field deflects particles from the giant's radiation belts, creating a small "magnetospheric shadow" on the far side. The surface consists of dark, iron-rich rocks.''',
    '''A "dust world". The entire surface is covered by a multi-meter layer of fine silicate dust resembling talc. Any movement raises opaque clouds that take months to settle. Beneath the dust lies a smooth basaltic plain.''',
    '''A satellite in orbital resonance with neighboring moons. Its orbit slightly pulsates, causing weak but regular "tidal moonquakes". The surface is covered with a network of shallow but very long cracks from these cyclic stresses.''',
    '''A world with relic ice lenses. In polar regions, beneath a thin regolith layer, lenses of water ice are preserved - remnants of cometary bombardment from the system's formation era. The ice never melts, only slowly sublimates.''',
    '''A "hot" moon in a close orbit. Infrared radiation from the giant heats its day side to temperatures where some minerals begin to emit faint glow. The night side instantly cools to cosmic cold. The surface is covered with fused silicate slag.''',

LAVA = [
    '''A world in a state of perpetual eruption. The surface is almost entirely covered by fresh basalt lava flows constantly renewed from thousands of active vents. The atmosphere is dense, poisonous, consisting of sulfurous gases and ash creating eternal night. Volcanic lightning regularly pierces the veil. There is no solid surface in the classical sense—only a thin crust on a molten ocean of magma.''',
    '''Planet of "fiery canyons". Its crust is split by a global network of rift valleys from which lava continuously erupts. These canyons, tens of kilometers wide, glow in the dark like scorched scars. The atmosphere is thin but saturated with toxic volcanic aerosols. Between the canyons lie dead plateaus of solidified lava covered with crack networks.''',
    '''"Boiling cauldron" — a young, unstable planet with extreme tectonic activity. Volcanoes here have no permanent vents; instead, the entire surface periodically bulges with magmatic bubbles that burst, flooding the surroundings with melt. The atmosphere is dynamic and changes composition depending on current eruptions.''',
    '''A world of cryovolcanism on a rocky base. At low temperatures, it erupts not silicate magma but superheated water saturated with dissolved salts and silica. These "mud" volcanoes create a landscape of solidified salt domes and silicate deposits. The atmosphere consists of water vapor and chlorine.''',
    '''A planet with magmatic "tides". Powerful tidal influence from a close star or giant causes regular, synchronized upwellings of magma through weakened crustal zones. Eruptions occur cyclically, like tides, flooding entire hemispheres. Between cycles, lava cools rapidly, forming a brittle, cracked crust.''',

TERRA = [
    '''World of "Primary Greenhouse Effect". The planet has near-Earth mass and liquid oceans, but its atmosphere is a dense carbon dioxide envelope with a pressure of 8 atmospheres. Surface temperature +50°C. Primitive black-purple vegetation, consisting of thermophilic lichens and shrubs, covers the continents. The atmosphere lacks free oxygen. Terraforming is possible through the introduction of genetically modified cyanobacteria to decompose CO2, followed by the introduction of Earth algae into the oceans and the creation of an oxygen atmosphere over 200-300 years.''',
    '''"Cold Twin". A planet with a nitrogen-argon atmosphere (pressure 0.9 Earth), but an average temperature of -30°C due to its distance from the star. It has unfrozen saline oceans thanks to subsurface geothermal activity. Land is covered with cryoflora — organisms using antifreeze proteins. The atmosphere is non-toxic but unbreathable. Terraforming requires orbital mirrors for heating, introduction of greenhouse gases (SF6), and introduction of cold-resistant plants for oxygen production. Implementation period — 150 years.''',
    '''Planet of "Methane-Nitrogen Equilibrium". Atmosphere: 40% N2, 40% CH4, 15% Ar, traces of complex hydrocarbons. Pressure 1.2 atm, temperature -10°C. Liquid hydrocarbon lakes coexist with water oceans. Vegetation consists of methane-consuming organisms. The main problem is the explosive atmosphere. Terraforming is possible through catalytic decomposition of methane using nanorobots, subsequent creation of an oxygen atmosphere by algae, and introduction of bacteria to bind residual hydrocarbons. Estimated timeframe — 400 years.''',
    '''"Supercontinent with Poisonous Seas". A planet with one giant continent and shallow oceans saturated with sulfur compounds. Atmosphere: 70% N2, 25% CO2, 5% SO2. Pressure 3 atm, temperature +40°C. Vegetation — sulfur-consuming giant fungi and algae. Terraforming requires large-scale ocean desulfurization through chemical precipitation, neutralization of CO2 by genetically modified organisms, and gradual replacement of native flora with Earth analogs. Project duration — 500-600 years.''',
    '''World of "Oxygen Freeze". A unique case: the atmosphere contains 18% oxygen but is almost devoid of greenhouse gases. Pressure 0.7 atm, temperature -60°C. Oceans are covered by an ice sheet, but liquid water exists beneath. Vegetation is cryptobiotic, in a state of anabiosis. Terraforming is most promising: it is sufficient to introduce greenhouse gases (CF4, C2F6) into the atmosphere to heat the planet by 80°C, after which a natural greenhouse effect from ice melt and water evaporation will initiate. Timeframe — less than 100 years.''',
