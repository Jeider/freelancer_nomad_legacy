# Planet Nortorf
rh_mnh_01_base = ("An intermediate base on the route from Honshu to Bismarck. Primarily serves a logistical function as a servicing zone for transports. No significant mining operations are conducted on the planet itself. Mineral extraction is carried out at minimal intensity. The floating platforms are mainly used for resupply. Colonists are primarily engaged in servicing trade ships. Rheinland continues to support this planet primarily due to the destruction of the Munich station, which was the main trade hub in this system. Due to the lack of official status, the planet Nortorf often hosts various bandits and pirates who use it as a freeport. Additionally, the inhabitants of Nortorf continue to scavenge scrap metal, primarily from the destroyed Munich station. This is a quite profitable activity since no one monitors the station. Rumors say that if one could hack certain segments of the station, they might even access the remaining working compartments and storerooms of Munich.")

# Trade Base Schleswig
rh_mnh_02_base = ("An important logistics center for delivering goods from Kusari to Rheinland and back. Base Schleswig is also the main mercenary base in the system, and since Munich has no official government presence, mercenaries handle most of the defensive duties. The base concentrates goods primarily from the Honshu system and services nearby trade lanes. There is also high activity of freelancer junkers who continue raids to the Regensburg station to dismantle it for parts, but this is becoming increasingly dangerous due to overall pirate activity and the presence of a Spanish Outcast enclave in this system.")

# Base Vigo
rh_mnh_03_base = ("Base Vigo is a distant outpost of the Outcasts almost in the very center of Sirius. This settlement appeared due to a confluence of circumstances. On one hand, a conflict between Rheinland and Kusari occurred in the Munich system, leading to its neutral status. On the other hand, the alliance between the Outcasts and Corsairs was broken, forcing all Outcasts living in Corsair colonies to urgently leave those systems. Thus, the Munich system happened to be the most unclaimed place in Sirius and became a gathering point for all Outcasts who did not decide to travel to Malta.\\n\\nLocal Outcasts engage in smuggling and petty banditry. Despite Munich's neutrality, all Outcast movements are monitored by Rheinland's armed forces. However, since official military presence is not extensive, local mercenaries from Asgard and Black Dragon handle the monitoring.")

# Warehouse Kreuzberg
rh_mnh_04_base = ("Kreuzberg is a secret junker outpost in Munich. The system itself holds little value as trade flows in Munich are insignificant, but the system contains a vast amount of scrap metal left after the war between Rheinland and Kusari. To transport metal more efficiently, the junkers built this outpost, which includes a smelting facility. Additionally, this warehouse is a Mecca for local bandits and smugglers who store their goods here and conduct deals for smuggling contraband to other systems. Unfortunately, due to high Asgard PMC activity, this warehouse has lost its strategic significance, but the junkers continue to maintain it.")

# Station Regensburg
rh_regensburgh = ("Station Regensburg was originally conceived as one of the most advanced outposts. Using cutting-edge technology, this outpost could withstand attacks from an entire enemy fleet. This situation greatly displeased the Kusari government, which decided to launch a preemptive strike on Rheinland. During a relatively short operation, Regensburg was completely destroyed. The same fate befell the Bismarck fleet sent to aid Regensburg. Kusari destroyers quickly laid minefields, blocking Rheinland's attacks, after which Kusari gunboats emerged to finish off the counterattacking Rheinland forces. As a result of this conflict, Rheinland lost the ability to assert its military presence in Munich, and this system became considered neutral and borderland. Rheinland military can still conduct operations in Munich, but they can no longer establish military bases or maintain garrisons here. In fairness, this treaty also prohibited such actions by Kusari. Thus, if Kusari were to capture a station and station a garrison, the peace treaty with Rheinland would automatically become void.\\n\\nThe Regensburg station itself is currently in a deplorable state. All accessible compartments have been stripped by junkers and outcasts, leaving only scrap metal, which local adventurers continue to dismantle. The situation is different with the remains of the battleships near Regensburg. Since no one dared to clear the minefields and not all rogues are willing to take such risks, the possibility of boarding the battleships and finding something interesting still exists.")

# Station Munich
rh_munchen = ("Station Munich was once the main station in the eponymous Munich system but was completely destroyed during a military conflict with Kusari. The primary cause of the conflict was the construction of the Regensburg station in the Munich system. Station Munich was involved in building Regensburg; its personnel were primarily engaged in supporting and supplying parts for the future Rheinland outpost. However, during the hostilities, Regensburg was destroyed, and after the Rheinland reinforcements were wiped out in a successful ambush, Kusari forces attacked Station Munich. Despite most of the station's personnel being civilians, Kusari carried out a massive bombardment. A huge number of civilians were killed, but the majority managed to escape either on their own ships or in escape pods. Kusari forces did not pursue the fleeing personnel. The escape pod survivors mostly found refuge on the planet Nortorf, while others attempted to flee to the Bismarck system.\\n\\nFollowing this incident, Station Munich was never rebuilt, primarily because the peace treaty between Rheinland and Kusari prohibited significant industrial facilities belonging to either house in the system. This led to a significant exodus of the civilian population from the Munich system, greatly impacting the system's economy. During Munich's heyday, the system was actively colonized by German settlers, but most chose to relocate to Rheinland's core systems, leaving mainly personnel servicing the trade lanes in Munich. The abundance of unclaimed scrap metal led to increased junker activity, and the loss of jobs for former Munich residents led to a significant rise in antisocial activity within Rheinland itself, strengthening the influence of the Bundschuh and Hessians, as the Hessians were once an auxiliary force protecting Rheinland's border zones. After significant budget cuts, Rheinland replaced the Hessians with the Asgard PMC, but the latter, failing to find worthy employment for their services, began to more actively use their forces against Rheinland's civilian population in various terrorist attacks.")

# Planet Bismarck
rh_biz_01_base = ("Planet Bismarck is the first settled German planet and also the Rheinland planet with the best living conditions. Despite harsh and long winters, living conditions here are far better than on other colonies. All governing institutions of Rheinland are concentrated on this planet.

Additionally, the station services all trade lanes in the Bismarck system.\\n\\nThe Interspace Corporation headquarters is located at Bremen station. This is where the corporation's main operations are conducted, and long-term contracts for the aforementioned routes are signed.\\n\\nBremen station handles long-distance shipments whose final destinations are Yokohama station in Omega-3 and Leeds station in the Warwick system. These stations have long-term contracts for purchasing Rheinland steel products, which are brought to Bremen awaiting further delivery via container transports.")

# Battleship Scharnhorst
rh_biz_03_base = ("Battleship Scharnhorst ensures Rheinland military presence in the Bismarck system. This battleship was decommissioned from the fleet and sent for refit at Köln station. Despite its outdated design, Scharnhorst's guns were upgraded to modern standards. Its main drawback is the inability to perform hyperspace jumps to other systems, which is why it is used as a static base in Bismarck. Nevertheless, the Rheinland Space Forces acknowledge its significance, as it is fully operational and capable of responding promptly to threats in the Bismarck system. Currently, the battleship's main tasks are technical support for patrols near planet Bismarck and border control with the Omega-15 system. If necessary, it can provide escort for trade ships departing to Omega-15. Such escorts usually stop at the jump gates to Stuttgart before returning to their permanent deployment location, though sometimes these patrols simultaneously rotate with the Bielefeld police outpost in Omega-15.")

# Research Station Münster
rh_biz_04_base = ("Station Münster is intended for research work near the planet Leidenschaft. The planet is surrounded by a unique ring containing elements of interest to local scientists. The main task of the research department is to analyze all incoming data, including that from independent pilots. The research department's developments at Münster can be purchased in the store. These are the most accessible and effective shield disruption guns in Rheinland. However, Münster's laboratories continue to work on improving these technologies. Rumors suggest that scientists are not only working on shield guns but also on super-modern multi-barrel machine guns. This weapon is unavailable to ordinary pilots, but its use has been observed among officers and elite units of Rheinland special forces command.")

# Station Köln
rh_biz_05_base = ("The main military base of Rheinland. Entry is strictly restricted.")

# Shipyard Kiel
rh_biz_06_base = ("The main shipyard of Rheinland. Primarily services trade vessels, but on rare occasions also handles military orders. This shipyard mainly works with medium-sized ships and vessels - Rheinland cruisers or long-class container transports. Sometimes it also services trains. The products of the Kiel shipyard are used by the Interspace Corporation on trade routes leading to Kusari. The shipyard also services ships traveling from Bretonia towards Omega-15 and the Stuttgart system.")

# Station Dortmund
rh_biz_07_base = ("Station Dortmund processes the garbage fields of the Bismarck system, which are abundantly filled with waste from the Kiel shipyard's operations. Dortmund's main products are various alloys formed as byproducts of processing this waste. The station most efficiently produces a local super-strong alloy, as well as various hull panels for stations, ships, and other structures. Dortmund's products are usually delivered to Bremen station for subsequent shipment to other systems.")

# Base Mainz
rh_biz_08_base = ("Base Mainz is an outpost of the Bundschuh faction. These pirates likely arrived from the Sigma-8 system. Initially, this outpost was simply a small storage facility but later attracted antisocial elements from planet Bismarck. Local pirates conduct raids on trade lanes adjacent to Bremen station.")

# Base Saarbrücken
rh_biz_09_base = ("This asteroid is a former abandoned Rheinland mining base. After the primary ore was exhausted, the base was abandoned and later occupied by the Hessians. The Hessians use this base as an intermediate smuggling storage and as a staging point for attacks on Bismarck's trade lanes. For this reason, the area around Saarbrücken is under careful surveillance by the Asgard PMC.")

# Planet Stuttgart
rh_stut_01_base = ("Planet Stuttgart is where most of Rheinland's heavy industry is concentrated. The planet is advantageously located near numerous resources. This led to a tremendous leap that allowed the placement of numerous factories for producing goods and parts of all kinds. The planet also has fairly good living conditions; in fact, they are even better than on planet Bismarck, so the abundant workforce further contributed to the development of all types of industry on the planet. Industry continues to develop with new technologies, as planet Stuttgart produces a vast number of machine tools for all kinds of manufacturing. Unfortunately, the planet was heavily affected by Rheinland's industrial decline, leading to rising unemployment and worsening security in the system due to increased piracy. Industries are trying to become more automated and less dependent on human labor. While this increases efficiency and profitability, it increasingly raises the issue of overpopulation, as most of the population is no longer needed for once labor-intensive production. Moreover, entire ghettos of unemployed people separated from the working part of society have begun to form. The local governor, Frau Grünwald, shows no concern for these problems and only strives to present the achievements of progress as impressively as possible to the occasional visiting aristocracy from planet Bismarck.")

# Outpost Zurich
rh_stut_02_base = ("Outpost Zurich handles border control of ships and vessels arriving from the Omega-7 system. Trade vessels then typically proceed towards planet Stuttgart. If repair is needed or if they wish to visit Rheinland's main production station - Mannheim station - trade convoys head towards the Rostock shipyard.")

# Shipyard Rostock
rh_stut_03_base = ("Shipyard Rostock is one of the most successful and efficient shipyards. This is due to its location: it has direct access to the industrially developed planet Stuttgart on one side, and on the other, it constantly receives alloys of all types directly from the industrial giant, Mannheim station. This allows for the production and repair of ships and vessels of all types at minimal prices. Rostock shipyard is the main producer of autonomous mining units.")

# Station Mannheim
rh_stut_04_base = ("Station Mannheim is the only giant from the era of Rheinland industrial dominance that has not lost its production power. From time to time, projects even emerged to expand production to include trade lane components, but this was abandoned due to the sharp drop in trade lane prices. The station produces almost all popular alloys at the most accessible prices. Even considering transportation costs for delivering resources, these are the most affordable prices for these goods. Additionally, the station is the main producer of parts for autonomous mining units, making their production at the neighboring Rostock shipyard one of the cheapest in Sirius.\\n\\nUnlike other industrial plants that went bankrupt, Mannheim never relied solely on the Rheinland market. Its goods in the form of alloys and crucial components are popular far beyond Rheinland. They are delivered even to the other end of Sirius due to their negligible production cost.")

# Trade Base Frankfurt
rh_stut_05_base = ("Base Frankfurt handles intermediate storage of goods destined for the Bismarck system. This trade post is the final point for Interspace Corporation movements related to the Hokkaido system. Containers are usually unloaded here, awaiting pickup by trade vessels assigned to Bremen station in the Bismarck system.

# Planet Baden-Baden
rh_stut_06_base = ("Planet Baden-Baden is the most luxurious resort in Rheinland territory and is also considered the breadbasket of all Sirius. The planet produces a special water with a unique composition of microelements that has proven therapeutic effects. For this reason, the planet hosts a huge number of resorts visited by the most influential people from all over Rheinland. The aforementioned special water can be purchased on this planet. This water is highly valued among the aristocracy of other houses, but local vacationers also demand various luxury items, so there is high demand for any luxury goods on this planet.")

# Base Freiburg

# Base Wiesbaden
rh_stut_08_base = ("Base Wiesbaden is used by junkers to utilize production waste from Mannheim station and planet Stuttgart. Despite the high environmental standards of production in Stuttgart, the problem of excess waste remains significant. Junkers take advantage of this to dismantle production remnants for parts and sell them at affordable prices. This station is also used by Bundschuh pirates. They maintain a small garrison here that conducts regular armed raids on trade routes leading from Omega-15 to planet Stuttgart. This activity is significantly hampered by the Rheinland military presence at the Zurich outpost.")

# Planet Berlin
rh_ber_01_base = ("Berlin is a planet with a harsh climate. During its settlement, plans were made to alter the atmospheric composition, but a shortage of colonies forced Rheinlanders to settle it as it was. This reduced the scale of settlement, so the planet began to be used for military purposes. It hosts numerous military factories that continuously produce various spare parts and components for Rheinland's fighters, gunboats, cruisers, and battleships. For a long time, the planet also housed Rheinland's first major prison. After conditions improved on the planet, settlement became more active, and it was decided to move the prison into space. However, after the decline in production and mass layoffs, the crime rate began to rise steadily, and authorities plan to reopen prisons on the planet's surface due to the inability to provide prison cells for all convicted criminals on the Schwerin prison.\\n\\nPlanet Berlin is also known for having some of the largest spectral ore deposits in the Sirius sector. Unfortunately, mining and processing the ore were still very expensive, and after brief use, Rheinland Space Forces abandoned the use of cloaking devices on large ships. Occasionally, these devices are used on fighters, but usually only in the empire's elite forces.")

# Prison Schwerin
rh_ber_02_base = ("Prison Schwerin was built at the edge of the Berlin system to ensure the safety of the population on the rapidly growing giant planet Berlin. The issue was that initially, planet Berlin was settled as a military outpost, so the largest prison in Rheinland was located there. However, during Berlin's significant industrialization, it was decided to close the prison and focus on industrial production. For this reason, the prison was relocated to orbit around planet Linden. New problems later emerged due to the failure of Berlin's industrialization. Due to geopolitical upheavals, a significant part of the population became impoverished and joined various criminal groups like the Bundschuh or Hessians. Therefore, Prison Schwerin was significantly expanded and now holds inmates from most of Rheinland.")

# Station Potsdam
rh_ber_04_base = ("Station Potsdam is the main orbital industrial giant of the Berlin system and, together with planet Berlin, is a source of vast amounts of scrap in this system. Potsdam is the main producer of ships for the Rheinland fleet, produces equipment for the army, and manufactures a huge amount of related products. Paradoxically, the primary authority on this station is the junker faction. Due to high corruption and significant lobbying, the station operates in a way that ensures junkers receive as much rejected goods or scrap deposits as possible, from which junkers derive significant profits. Local authorities desperately try to change this situation, but all attempts have been futile. New station mayors either eventually become corrupt or end up dead. Therefore, there are entire ghettos on the station controlled by bandits, forcing the army to conduct regular raids. Rumors suggest the army has even proposed simply deactivating some sections and replacing them with new ones to avoid dealing with the station's political situation, but junkers and other bandits successfully blend with the civilian population, preventing authorities from taking harsher measures.")

It provides logistical support for Rheinland military patrols in the Sigma-8 system near the Monaco base. Rumors suggest that Rheinland forces are planning expeditions to the area of the Minor Omicron system, where jump holes regularly form. This should help reduce Corsair pirate activity in this system. However, the likelihood of such developments remains low, as the Corsairs heavily defend Minor Omicron from lawful incursions.")

# Warehouse Suhl

At one time, the Bundschuh formed an alliance with the Corsairs, allowing the Corsairs to establish a serious military base in this region. Using significant military supplies, the Corsairs managed to inflict a major defeat on Rheinland, but this economically complicated Vernigorod's operations, as the incident led to the relocation of the trade route from the Monaco area to the Starke area, which is farther away and much better patrolled. Nevertheless, the Bundschuh continue their raids even in this situation.")

# Freeport ruins
sig8_monako = ("Base Monaco was previously a trade base on an alternative route in the Sigma-8 system. This route was long the only trade lane in this system, but due to increasing pirate attacks, authorities decided to reconsider the movement directions of trade ships. The main turning point was the industrialization of planet Berlin and the beginning of construction of Station Starke, aimed at asserting Rheinland's military presence in this system. Sigma-8 began to be populated relatively quickly, and the turning point was a large-scale pirate offensive on Base Monaco. To defend the base, several battleships were dispatched; although they managed to inflict significant damage on the Corsairs, the Corsairs turned out to be much better equipped than Rheinland military anticipated. Several battleships were destroyed, forcing Rheinland to withdraw its forces from the asteroid field, and the Monaco base garrison and personnel were completely evacuated. After this incident, only local PMC forces, including the Asgard PMC, were responsible for the security of this area. Base Monaco was abandoned, but rumors suggest that some of its modules still function and that something special and useful can be found in the old storerooms.")
