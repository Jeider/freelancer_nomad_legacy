Colonists are primarily engaged in servicing trade ships. Rheinland continues to support this planet primarily due to the destruction of the Munich station, which was the main trade hub in this system. Due to the lack of official status, the planet Nortorf often hosts various bandits and pirates who use it as a freeport. Additionally, the inhabitants of Nortorf continue to scavenge scrap metal, primarily from the destroyed Munich station. This is a quite profitable activity since no one monitors the station.

There is also high activity of freelancer junkers who continue raids to the Regensburg station to dismantle it for parts, but this is becoming increasingly dangerous due to overall pirate activity and the presence of a Spanish Outcast enclave in this system.")

# Base Vigo
rh_mnh_03_base = ("Base Vigo is a distant outpost of the Outcasts almost in the very center of Sirius. This settlement appeared due to a confluence of circumstances. On one hand, a conflict between Rheinland and Kusari occurred in the Munich system, leading to its neutral status. On the other hand, the alliance between the Outcasts and Corsairs was broken, forcing all Outcasts living in Corsair colonies to urgently leave those systems. Thus, the Munich system happened to be the most unclaimed place in Sirius and became a gathering point for all Outcasts who did not decide to travel to Malta.\\n\\nLocal Outcasts engage in smuggling and petty banditry.

The same fate befell the Bismarck fleet sent to aid Regensburg. Kusari destroyers quickly laid minefields, blocking Rheinland's attacks, after which Kusari gunboats emerged to finish off the counterattacking Rheinland forces. As a result of this conflict, Rheinland lost the ability to assert its military presence in Munich, and this system became considered neutral and borderland. Rheinland military can still conduct operations in Munich, but they can no longer establish military bases or maintain garrisons here. In fairness, this treaty also prohibited such actions by Kusari. Thus, if Kusari were to capture a station and station a garrison, the peace treaty with Rheinland would automatically become void.\\n\\nThe Regensburg station itself is currently in a deplorable state. All accessible compartments have been stripped by junkers and outcasts, leaving only scrap metal, which local adventurers continue to dismantle. The situation is different with the remains of the battleships near Regensburg.

# Station Munich
rh_munchen = ("Station Munich was once the main station in the eponymous Munich system but was completely destroyed during a military conflict with Kusari. The primary cause of the conflict was the construction of the Regensburg station in the Munich system. Station Munich was involved in building Regensburg; its personnel were primarily engaged in supporting and supplying parts for the future Rheinland outpost. However, during the hostilities, Regensburg was destroyed, and after the Rheinland reinforcements were wiped out in a successful ambush, Kusari forces attacked Station Munich. Despite most of the station's personnel being civilians, Kusari carried out a massive bombardment. A huge number of civilians were killed, but the majority managed to escape either on their own ships or in escape pods. Kusari forces did not pursue the fleeing personnel. The escape pod survivors mostly found refuge on the planet Nortorf, while others attempted to flee to the Bismarck system.\\n\\nFollowing this incident, Station Munich was never rebuilt, primarily because the peace treaty between Rheinland and Kusari prohibited significant industrial facilities belonging to either house in the system. This led to a significant exodus of the civilian population from the Munich system, greatly impacting the system's economy. During Munich's heyday, the system was actively colonized by German settlers, but most chose to relocate to Rheinland's core systems, leaving mainly personnel servicing the trade lanes in Munich. The abundance of unclaimed scrap metal led to increased junker activity, and the loss of jobs for former Munich residents led to a significant rise in antisocial activity within Rheinland itself, strengthening the influence of the Bundschuh and Hessians, as the Hessians were once an auxiliary force protecting Rheinland's border zones. After significant budget cuts, Rheinland replaced the Hessians with the Asgard PMC, but the latter, failing to find worthy employment for their services, began to more actively use their forces against Rheinland's civilian population in various terrorist attacks.")

Due to high corruption and significant lobbying, the station operates in a way that ensures junkers receive as much rejected goods or scrap deposits as possible, from which junkers derive significant profits. Local authorities desperately try to change this situation, but all attempts have been futile. New station mayors either eventually become corrupt or end up dead. Therefore, there are entire ghettos on the station controlled by bandits, forcing the army to conduct regular raids.

The planet is also used as a Bretonian base under the program to control the activity of the Irish Republican Army, as one of the outer perimeters of Ulster station is located not far from this system. Bretonia provides significant resources to maintain law and order in this system, but this, in turn, ended in failure when Bretonian forces, together with Liberty forces, attempted to capture Ulster's outer perimeter in the Limerick station area. It was a rather dark day for the Bretonian navy, as several battleships and a significant number of destroyers were lost. After this incident, Bretonia only performs police functions in Sigma-22 and has concentrated its attention on Ulster only from the Cambridge system side. It is also worth noting that the old trade route from Warwick to Columbia passed through Freeport 4.

This PMC was tasked with patrolling the territory adjacent to the Ulster system in an area with a large number of shipwrecks. The Sigma-22 system is in a zone of constant threat from both the Irish Republican Army and the Confederates. The Liberty government attempted to resolve this issue through an alliance with Bretonia and a swift assault on Ulster's positions, but this system, like its outer perimeter, turned out to be heavily defended. For this reason, Constanta station was significantly reinforced to withstand regular terrorist attacks.

Despite the overall failure of the operation, the battleship's command received promotions for preserving the ship intact. The second battleship in that operation, the Pennsylvania, was unable to successfully leave the battlefield, so its wreckage still lies in the asteroid field on the way to the enemy Limerick base.

For a long time, the governments of Bretonia and Liberty turned a blind eye to the situation, leading to a mass exodus of the population from Freeport 4, and it gradually became inhabited exclusively by pirates and smugglers. Flying along this trade route became too dangerous, leading to the decision to eliminate the threat in the Limerick base area and free Freeport 4 from pirate influence. But as usual, things did not go according to plan. The operation was coordinated very poorly, and due to differing visions of the operation\'s objectives between Bretonia and Liberty, it led to catastrophic consequences. Initially, it was planned to destroy the Limerick base with a powerful assault or at least suppress its defenses, but the IRA was forewarned of the attack and laid minefields in time, forcing the Bretonian ships to attack through an asteroid field where a large fleet\'s maneuvering capabilities were severely limited. The greatest threat was a potential attack from Freeport 4, which, incidentally, did occur. The Bretonian forces were surrounded, and the Liberty forces received orders to eliminate the threat from Freeport 4. The American command, as usual, solved the problem in its own way and simply decided to destroy Freeport 4 with the arsenal originally intended for Limerick. This is a clear case where a formally civilian facility was destroyed by the forces of one of the house governments. This strike did reduce pressure from the pirates and diverted their forces, allowing the battered remnants of the Bretonian fleet to escape the asteroid field. Liberty, however, managed to preserve most of its fleet intact, except for the battleship Pennsylvania. Rumors suggest that Liberty deliberately conducted the operation in such a way as to eliminate a civilian base formally affiliated with Bretonia. At the same time, despite the abundance of pirates, precise information on the number of civilians on the freeport was unknown. This now serves as additional fuel for conspiracy theories against Liberty. Nevertheless, at present, the freeport is destroyed, and there is simply no possibility of its restoration, as this zone is under too much pressure from the IRA, and Bretonia has decided to concentrate its forces on confronting Ulster from the Cambridge system side.')

As the planet is one of the starting points of the trade route to Rheinland, the production of trade ships on the planet is set up so that many of them are immediately loaded and sent to their final destination, planet Stuttgart.\\n\\nThere are several opposing views on logistics on the planet, leading to many conflicts, especially during the distribution of government grants. The essence of this conflict lies in the principles of further development of logistics technologies. On one side are the manufacturers of new types of engines, developers of portable hyperdrive systems. With these devices, trade lanes and jump gates could become meaningless, and it would no longer be necessary to build a huge logistics network just to transport cargo from point A to point B. On the other side are the manufacturers of these space and inter-system travel devices themselves. The main part of Forbes' industry is tied to the production of trade lanes and jump gates. And if jump gates are still popular and require parts, trade lanes have recently even stopped being repaired. They do not contribute to improved security and sometimes, on the contrary, attract pirate attention. They have also fallen behind in development compared to ordinary engines. A simple engine in cruise mode is only slightly slower than the speeds achievable on trade lanes. Therefore, many promising developments in this logistics sphere have become useless.

Although DeepSpace has sold the license to produce trade lanes to many factories, it is Detroit station that produces the majority of all trade lanes used in the Sirius sector. Unfortunately, the rapid development of engines has significantly reduced the appeal of trade lanes. If in earlier times trade lanes allowed speeds four times greater than the best ship's cruise engine, now this figure is only half of the best engine. For this reason, DeepSpace began developing new, perfect, super-fast trade lanes, but here too they faced failure, as such speeds are not in demand in the inner colonies due to the not-so-great distances within systems. Therefore, the only working prototype of a modern trade lane still stands near the station as an abandoned museum exhibit. Now DeepSpace is intensively developing other means of travel between systems, such as compact engines for fighters. Currently, only battleships can afford such hyperdrives. If DeepSpace succeeds in developing such a hyperdrive, it will revolutionize the logistics system of the Sirius sector.

At some point, the population of Columbia was alarmed by political changes in Liberty, so they wanted to secede and establish their own model of confederate rule. Despite significant support among Liberty's population, the main industrial class did not side with the Confederates, so the Dixie had to rely solely on the support of the trade elite and some military. As a result of the uprising, the Confederates managed to capture only a small part of the stations in Columbia, Sigma-22, and Tau-31. The counterattack by Liberty forces was quite successful, and Liberty forces managed to cut off the headquarters at Freeport 1 from the main Confederate forces. After that, the organized resistance of the new state was suppressed, garrisons eliminated. The Confederate cell in Sigma-22 held out the longest, but it was suppressed under the pretext of war with Irish separatists. Freeport 1 itself was much better defended, but this only allowed it to meet its fate later. The presence of an asteroid field improved the freeport's defense, but Liberty brought an entire fleet and, using heavy linear cruisers, managed to suppress the defense systems and completely destroy the freeport. All remnants of the Confederate garrison had already been withdrawn to Palmito or were eliminated or arrested, so the main blow fell on the freeport's civilian population, whom Liberty simply classified as smugglers. After that, no one else planned to join the Confederates, and those who tried quickly became inmates of the numerous prisons in both Columbia and New York. The prison in New York, although a quite terrible place, would be an even worse option to end up doing hard labor in Houston or Pittsburgh. Convicts were usually sent to such work on a one-way trip. Information about those released simply does not exist.\\n\\nNow Freeport 1 consists merely of debris from the potential of Confederate forces. The remnants of the Confederates settled at the mysterious Richmond base. Meanwhile, some nodes of Freeport 1 are technically still functioning. Perhaps with their help, one can find something to profit from in the remains of this base.")

# Station Colorado
tau31_01_base = ("Station Colorado handles the full cycle of gas processing in the Tau-31 system and is also a strong outpost for Liberty forces on the trade route towards Bretonia and the Cambridge system. This station has already extracted the most valuable gas from its location zone, so it requires loading with liquefied gas from nearby gas installations to ultimately produce full-fledged, highly efficient hydrogen fuel.")

# Battleship Louisiana
tau31_02_base = ("Battleship Louisiana proudly carries out its duty to protect trade routes leading to Columbia from encroachments by various rabble. The initial task of this battleship was to support research at Massachusetts station. But after the unsuccessful conclusion of those experiments, the battleship's combat mission was changed. Therefore, it currently performs only a military function to protect gas miners located throughout the Tau-31 system.")

# Trade Base Florida
tau31_03_base = ("Trade Base Florida is the main intermediate station on the trade route from Bretonia towards New York. At this base, traders arriving from the Tau-31 system, bringing goods from the Cambridge system, leave their goods. Subsequently, these goods are transferred to transports heading towards Columbia or New York. This base also combines the functions of a police outpost, thus ensuring border defense of the Tau-31 system and border control of all arriving ships and vessels. The base also supports the trade lanes of Tau-31. At this base, one can not only find various traders resting after long flights but also familiarize themselves with their goods.")

# Base Tubac
tau31_04_base = ("Base Tubac is engaged in producing hydrogen fuel for pirate needs. Liberty Rogues use this base as a stronghold for attacks on trade routes from Columbia towards the gas miner Colorado.")

# Base Corinth
tau31_05_base = ("The Confederates use Tubac to organize attacks on the lucrative trade route from Bretonia to New York. This is a real center of the local smuggling industry because the base actively sells stolen or illicitly produced goods through its people at Colorado station.")

tau31_scient = ("Research station Massachusetts was studying alien cells of the Procyon-4 class. In the Tau-31 system, there are fields of dense gas clouds, and in one of them, an unprecedented concentration of alien cells was discovered. It was decided to build a huge research station capable of conducting the full spectrum of analysis of these organisms. All research proceeded quite successfully, so Liberty continuously expanded the program's funding.\\n\\nTo accelerate the work, it was decided to study distant icy asteroids from the far sector of the system. The icy asteroids were delivered, and indeed something living was discovered in them. Scientists began conducting experiments and managed to combine Procyon-4 with the organisms found in the icy asteroids. But this led to terrible results. The research went out of control, and strange signals began coming from the station, as if the resulting creature began attacking people, transforming into local pets, and rapidly spreading throughout the entire station. This new alien life form was structurally different from the Nomads but posed a significant threat, so it was imperative that it not spread beyond the station.\\n\\nThanks to the efforts of a scientist named James MacReady, the station was not only powered down but also activated a self-destruct protocol. All station personnel were killed, and the remaining oxygen was ignited to burn away all traces of life on the station. Currently, the station is completely abandoned, and access to it is restricted. However, there is still a possibility to access some docking modules to study the station's remains. Fortunately, only robots remain on the station, so visiting these sealed blocks poses no threat.")
