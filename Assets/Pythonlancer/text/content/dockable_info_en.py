Colonists are primarily engaged in servicing trade ships. Rheinland continues to support this planet primarily due to the destruction of the Munich station, which was the main trade hub in this system. Due to the lack of official status, the planet Nortorf often hosts various bandits and pirates who use it as a freeport. Additionally, the inhabitants of Nortorf continue to scavenge scrap metal, primarily from the destroyed Munich station. This is a quite profitable activity since no one monitors the station.

There is also high activity of freelancer junkers who continue raids to the Regensburg station to dismantle it for parts, but this is becoming increasingly dangerous due to overall pirate activity and the presence of a Spanish Outcast enclave in this system.")

# Base Vigo
rh_mnh_03_base = ("Base Vigo is a distant outpost of the Outcasts almost in the very center of Sirius. This settlement appeared due to a confluence of circumstances. On one hand, a conflict between Rheinland and Kusari occurred in the Munich system, leading to its neutral status. On the other hand, the alliance between the Outcasts and Corsairs was broken, forcing all Outcasts living in Corsair colonies to urgently leave those systems. Thus, the Munich system happened to be the most unclaimed place in Sirius and became a gathering point for all Outcasts who did not decide to travel to Malta.\\n\\nLocal Outcasts engage in smuggling and petty banditry.

The same fate befell the Bismarck fleet sent to aid Regensburg. Kusari destroyers quickly laid minefields, blocking Rheinland's attacks, after which Kusari gunboats emerged to finish off the counterattacking Rheinland forces. As a result of this conflict, Rheinland lost the ability to assert its military presence in Munich, and this system became considered neutral and borderland. Rheinland military can still conduct operations in Munich, but they can no longer establish military bases or maintain garrisons here. In fairness, this treaty also prohibited such actions by Kusari. Thus, if Kusari were to capture a station and station a garrison, the peace treaty with Rheinland would automatically become void.\\n\\nThe Regensburg station itself is currently in a deplorable state. All accessible compartments have been stripped by junkers and outcasts, leaving only scrap metal, which local adventurers continue to dismantle. The situation is different with the remains of the battleships near Regensburg.

# Station Munich
rh_munchen = ("Station Munich was once the main station in the eponymous Munich system but was completely destroyed during a military conflict with Kusari. The primary cause of the conflict was the construction of the Regensburg station in the Munich system. Station Munich was involved in building Regensburg; its personnel were primarily engaged in supporting and supplying parts for the future Rheinland outpost. However, during the hostilities, Regensburg was destroyed, and after the Rheinland reinforcements were wiped out in a successful ambush, Kusari forces attacked Station Munich. Despite most of the station's personnel being civilians, Kusari carried out a massive bombardment. A huge number of civilians were killed, but the majority managed to escape either on their own ships or in escape pods. Kusari forces did not pursue the fleeing personnel. The escape pod survivors mostly found refuge on the planet Nortorf, while others attempted to flee to the Bismarck system.\\n\\nFollowing this incident, Station Munich was never rebuilt, primarily because the peace treaty between Rheinland and Kusari prohibited significant industrial facilities belonging to either house in the system. This led to a significant exodus of the civilian population from the Munich system, greatly impacting the system's economy. During Munich's heyday, the system was actively colonized by German settlers, but most chose to relocate to Rheinland's core systems, leaving mainly personnel servicing the trade lanes in Munich. The abundance of unclaimed scrap metal led to increased junker activity, and the loss of jobs for former Munich residents led to a significant rise in antisocial activity within Rheinland itself, strengthening the influence of the Bundschuh and Hessians, as the Hessians were once an auxiliary force protecting Rheinland's border zones. After significant budget cuts, Rheinland replaced the Hessians with the Asgard PMC, but the latter, failing to find worthy employment for their services, began to more actively use their forces against Rheinland's civilian population in various terrorist attacks.")

Due to high corruption and significant lobbying, the station operates in a way that ensures junkers receive as much rejected goods or scrap deposits as possible, from which junkers derive significant profits. Local authorities desperately try to change this situation, but all attempts have been futile. New station mayors either eventually become corrupt or end up dead. Therefore, there are entire ghettos on the station controlled by bandits, forcing the army to conduct regular raids.

The planet is also used as a Bretonian base under the program to control the activity of the Irish Republican Army, as one of the outer perimeters of Ulster station is located not far from this system. Bretonia provides significant resources to maintain law and order in this system, but this, in turn, ended in failure when Bretonian forces, together with Liberty forces, attempted to capture Ulster's outer perimeter in the Limerick station area. It was a rather dark day for the Bretonian navy, as several battleships and a significant number of destroyers were lost. After this incident, Bretonia only performs police functions in Sigma-22 and has concentrated its attention on Ulster only from the Cambridge system side. It is also worth noting that the old trade route from Warwick to Columbia passed through Freeport 4.

This PMC was tasked with patrolling the territory adjacent to the Ulster system in an area with a large number of shipwrecks. The Sigma-22 system is in a zone of constant threat from both the Irish Republican Army and the Confederates. The Liberty government attempted to resolve this issue through an alliance with Bretonia and a swift assault on Ulster's positions, but this system, like its outer perimeter, turned out to be heavily defended. For this reason, Constanta station was significantly reinforced to withstand regular terrorist attacks.

Despite the overall failure of the operation, the battleship's command received promotions for preserving the ship intact. The second battleship in that operation, the Pennsylvania, was unable to successfully leave the battlefield, so its wreckage still lies in the asteroid field on the way to the enemy Limerick base.

For a long time, the governments of Bretonia and Liberty turned a blind eye to the situation, leading to a mass exodus of the population from Freeport 4, and it gradually became inhabited exclusively by pirates and smugglers. Flying along this trade route became too dangerous, leading to the decision to eliminate the threat in the Limerick base area and free Freeport 4 from pirate influence. But as usual, things did not go according to plan. The operation was coordinated very poorly, and due to differing visions of the operation\'s objectives between Bretonia and Liberty, it led to catastrophic consequences. Initially, it was planned to destroy the Limerick base with a powerful assault or at least suppress its defenses, but the IRA was forewarned of the attack and laid minefields in time, forcing the Bretonian ships to attack through an asteroid field where a large fleet\'s maneuvering capabilities were severely limited. The greatest threat was a potential attack from Freeport 4, which, incidentally, did occur. The Bretonian forces were surrounded, and the Liberty forces received orders to eliminate the threat from Freeport 4. The American command, as usual, solved the problem in its own way and simply decided to destroy Freeport 4 with the arsenal originally intended for Limerick. This is a clear case where a formally civilian facility was destroyed by the forces of one of the house governments. This strike did reduce pressure from the pirates and diverted their forces, allowing the battered remnants of the Bretonian fleet to escape the asteroid field. Liberty, however, managed to preserve most of its fleet intact, except for the battleship Pennsylvania. Rumors suggest that Liberty deliberately conducted the operation in such a way as to eliminate a civilian base formally affiliated with Bretonia. At the same time, despite the abundance of pirates, precise information on the number of civilians on the freeport was unknown. This now serves as additional fuel for conspiracy theories against Liberty. Nevertheless, at present, the freeport is destroyed, and there is simply no possibility of its restoration, as this zone is under too much pressure from the IRA, and Bretonia has decided to concentrate its forces on confronting Ulster from the Cambridge system side.')

As the planet is one of the starting points of the trade route to Rheinland, the production of trade ships on the planet is set up so that many of them are immediately loaded and sent to their final destination, planet Stuttgart.\\n\\nThere are several opposing views on logistics on the planet, leading to many conflicts, especially during the distribution of government grants. The essence of this conflict lies in the principles of further development of logistics technologies. On one side are the manufacturers of new types of engines, developers of portable hyperdrive systems. With these devices, trade lanes and jump gates could become meaningless, and it would no longer be necessary to build a huge logistics network just to transport cargo from point A to point B. On the other side are the manufacturers of these space and inter-system travel devices themselves. The main part of Forbes' industry is tied to the production of trade lanes and jump gates. And if jump gates are still popular and require parts, trade lanes have recently even stopped being repaired. They do not contribute to improved security and sometimes, on the contrary, attract pirate attention. They have also fallen behind in development compared to ordinary engines. A simple engine in cruise mode is only slightly slower than the speeds achievable on trade lanes. Therefore, many promising developments in this logistics sphere have become useless.

Although DeepSpace has sold the license to produce trade lanes to many factories, it is Detroit station that produces the majority of all trade lanes used in the Sirius sector. Unfortunately, the rapid development of engines has significantly reduced the appeal of trade lanes. If in earlier times trade lanes allowed speeds four times greater than the best ship's cruise engine, now this figure is only half of the best engine. For this reason, DeepSpace began developing new, perfect, super-fast trade lanes, but here too they faced failure, as such speeds are not in demand in the inner colonies due to the not-so-great distances within systems. Therefore, the only working prototype of a modern trade lane still stands near the station as an abandoned museum exhibit. Now DeepSpace is intensively developing other means of travel between systems, such as compact engines for fighters. Currently, only battleships can afford such hyperdrives. If DeepSpace succeeds in developing such a hyperdrive, it will revolutionize the logistics system of the Sirius sector.

At some point, the population of Columbia was alarmed by political changes in Liberty, so they wanted to secede and establish their own model of confederate rule. Despite significant support among Liberty's population, the main industrial class did not side with the Confederates, so the Dixie had to rely solely on the support of the trade elite and some military. As a result of the uprising, the Confederates managed to capture only a small part of the stations in Columbia, Sigma-22, and Tau-31. The counterattack by Liberty forces was quite successful, and Liberty forces managed to cut off the headquarters at Freeport 1 from the main Confederate forces. After that, the organized resistance of the new state was suppressed, garrisons eliminated. The Confederate cell in Sigma-22 held out the longest, but it was suppressed under the pretext of war with Irish separatists. Freeport 1 itself was much better defended, but this only allowed it to meet its fate later. The presence of an asteroid field improved the freeport's defense, but Liberty brought an entire fleet and, using heavy linear cruisers, managed to suppress the defense systems and completely destroy the freeport. All remnants of the Confederate garrison had already been withdrawn to Palmito or were eliminated or arrested, so the main blow fell on the freeport's civilian population, whom Liberty simply classified as smugglers. After that, no one else planned to join the Confederates, and those who tried quickly became inmates of the numerous prisons in both Columbia and New York. The prison in New York, although a quite terrible place, would be an even worse option to end up doing hard labor in Houston or Pittsburgh. Convicts were usually sent to such work on a one-way trip. Information about those released simply does not exist.\\n\\nNow Freeport 1 consists merely of debris from the potential of Confederate forces. The remnants of the Confederates settled at the mysterious Richmond base. Meanwhile, some nodes of Freeport 1 are technically still functioning.

The icy asteroids were delivered, and indeed something living was discovered in them. Scientists began conducting experiments and managed to combine Procyon-4 with the organisms found in the icy asteroids. But this led to terrible results. The research went out of control, and strange signals began coming from the station, as if the resulting creature began attacking people, transforming into local pets, and rapidly spreading throughout the entire station. This new alien life form was structurally different from the Nomads but posed a significant threat, so it was imperative that it not spread beyond the station.\\n\\nThanks to the efforts of a scientist named James MacReady, the station was not only powered down but also activated a self-destruct protocol. All station personnel were killed, and the remaining oxygen was ignited to burn away all traces of life on the station. Currently, the station is completely abandoned, and access to it is restricted.

# Base Wako
ku_hkd_08_base = ("Wako Base is an operational base of the Farmer's Alliance in Hokkaido territory. The base is used for aggressive attacks on trade routes between Yokohama and Omega-7. The farmers also attack the Imabari shipyard and desperately try to disrupt "
                  "the production of Kusari battleships, the most dangerous anti-pirate weapon. Sometimes even other pirates fly to Wako to support such attacks, as with too strong and powerful a Kusari fleet, all pirates would be under threat. Which must never be allowed.")

ku_hkd_research = ("Fukushima Station was a site for developing next-generation power systems but was destroyed due to an incident. Work on the station was conducted inside a trash field, where, due to radiation, strange new "
                   "energy elements began to form. But the station's creators miscalculated possible threats from nearby passing trash. During an unclear incident, an explosion occurred, causing noticeable inertial movement of a large "
                   "mass of trash. And all of it collided with the poorly protected parts of the station, deformation disrupted the research complex's operation, the new energy elements went out of control and destroyed the station's core. Fukushima was abandoned, but "

# Station Harajuku
om7_01_base = ("Harajuku Gas Mining Station is the main supplier of liquefied gas and gas fuel on the Kusari market. "
               "Additionally, Harajuku serves as an outpost in the Omega-7 system due to its border status and "
               "relatively high activity from the Shinobi clan. Moreover, intelligence knows for sure that in this system "
               "there is a headquarters of the pirate clan. Therefore, a small military unit of the Kusari VKS is always on full alert and "

# Station Wolfsburg
om7_02_base = ("Wolfsburg Station produces gas for the transport needs of Rheinland. This station is essentially a border post, as it also "
               "conducts inspection of ships and vessels passing along the trade route from Hokkaido to Stuttgart. At the same time, the station has significantly depleted "
               "the nearest gas accumulations, causing it to require regular supplies of liquefied gas from the nearest autonomous gas mining stations "

# Battleship Ostfriesland
om7_03_base = ("The Ostfriesland battleship serves to protect the Rheinland-controlled zone of Omega-7 in the sector previously protected by the Fischhafen outpost. "
               "This outpost was destroyed by Shinobi forces, causing this zone to lose protection and require emergency measures to restore order. "
               "For this reason, Rheinland tasked its troops with organizing defense against both Shinobi clan forces and Hessians and their allies. There is also information about corsair activity in this "

# Freeport Ryojun
om7_04_base = ("Ryojun Freeport is neutral territory on the route between Rheinland and Kusari. This freeport noticeably benefits from its neutral position, so no PMC can "
               "gain full control over it, causing a huge number of contraband warehouses to be located at the base. This allows any free trader to obtain "

# Base Kyoto
om7_05_base = ("Kyoto Base is located in a field of explosive gases in the Omega-7 system and was built as a secret residence for the Kusari Shogun "

               "no Shogun ever visited Kyoto. Soon it was repurposed for military, and later even for research "
               "functions. Gradually, the station was left almost unprotected and was captured by Shinobi clan members during an assault. "
               "The clan organized its central headquarters at the station and converted it into a huge pirate base. "
               "Kyoto is the center of pirate activity in the nearby territories, housing huge contraband warehouses, "

               "In their time, clan members committed countless contract killings of Corsairs, "
               "forever blackening relations between the factions. The situation is aggravated by the fact that "
               "in the Omega-7 system there is a Corsair anomaly, and many merchant ships and military vessels of the Spanish pass through it. "
               "On one hand, the Shinobi want to establish control over these supplies; on the other, the Corsairs actively resist this, and "

# Base Helgoland
om7_06_base = ("The Hessians established themselves at Helgoland Base, built from the remnants of destroyed autonomous gas miners. This base supplies the Hessians with fuel, allowing "
               "them to much more easily provide themselves with energy in remote bases. This base is also a contraband warehouse sold at Wolfsburg Base. Rheinland regularly tries to eliminate this base, but usually these "
               "attempts are futile, as the Hessians have their people in the local Rheinland military group, so they receive important information in a timely manner.")

om7_old_outpost = ("Fischhafen Station was a Rheinland border outpost on the way to Kyoto Station. Construction of this station was carried out under "
                   "an official agreement. Thus, Rheinland gained greater control over Omega-7, but also concluded a cooperation agreement with Kusari to "
                   "ensure protection of the trade line from Corsair and pirate attacks. But after the Blood Dragons left Kyoto and relocated to Hokkaido, the Kusari government "
                   "significantly lost interest in Kyoto Station. After pirates managed to capture Kyoto, Fischhafen Station began to suffer regular attacks, and the trade route to Kyoto was disrupted. "
                   "The governments of Kusari and Rheinland concluded that the threat from Kyoto was too great and decided to conduct an operation to storm the station, but, as usual happens, Kyoto's expanded capabilities were used "
                   "by the pirates as they should. Thanks to timely mining, Rheinland and Kusari forces fell into a trap, and several battleships were destroyed. Remnants of these battleships are still near Kyoto Station. "
                   "Ultimately, allied forces had to retreat to previous defense lines, but the Shinobi took advantage of Rheinland forces' shaky position and attacked Fischhafen. "
                   "This attack was repelled by battered Rheinland forces, but they realized that holding this station had become pointless and dangerous. So they mined the station and evacuated all personnel and garrison. The Shinobi tried to approach the station, "
                   "but were hit by the blast wave from activated mines. Thus, Rheinland stopped the enemy advance and gave themselves time to regroup. Unfortunately, gas miners in the Fischhafen area had to be abandoned, but "
                   "Rheinland forces could more concentratedly defend the remaining trade routes in the lower part of Omega-7. Thus, Fischhafen remained abandoned and destroyed. Scavengers regularly fly to it to try to find something valuable among the station wreckage. "
                   "But some compartments of the station may still function autonomously. Theoretically, if you hack the doors, you can enter them.")
