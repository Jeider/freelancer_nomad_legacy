LASERBEAM_COMPONENTS = ('Laser emitters allow for directing significant flows of various energy with immense power. In military applications, emitters are used to create combat lasers. In peaceful purposes, emitters are indispensable for creating external shield generators and terraforming orbital stations.')

This alloy is used in creating simple ship components or in constructing ground-based structures.')

These cylinders are not very expensive in the central colonies, as plants are usually located in systems adjacent to gas miners (and some gas miners produce hydrogen fuel directly). On the other hand, liquefied gas is more convenient to transport due to lower explosiveness.')
GAS_LIQUID = ('Cylinders with liquefied gas. This is a fairly efficient energy source, but to use it as fuel for ship power systems, this gas requires additional processing.')

Despite the declining efficiency of trade lanes, their popularity will not wane for a long time, and the most damaged ones require spare parts.')
ENGINE_COMPONENTS = ('Engine parts are used in producing one of the most crucial parts of any ship — the engine. Engine components are usually produced in locations near deposits of refractory ores. But such ore is not mined everywhere, so engine components are needed to sustain engine production throughout Sirius.')
JG_COMPONENTS = ('The development level of warp drives for ordinary ships is still very low, so the primary means of travel in Sirius are jump gates. And, like any device, they wear out sooner or later. Jump gate parts are extremely necessary both for repairing old gates and for constructing new ones.')

Natural food has a relatively short shelf life and therefore must be delivered to the recipient as quickly as possible. At the same time, natural food remains a privilege of the upper class, as in terms of taste and nutritional value it has long been inferior to synthetic food.')

GREENHOUSE_PARTS = ('Many space stations have modules with greenhouses. These greenhouses are designed to generate air through photosynthesis. Thanks to this, such stations can remain without additional maintenance for extended periods. Station personnel cannot live without air, which is why equipment to maintain the operation of such greenhouses is extremely necessary on a station.')
GOLD = ('Once the most precious metal, gold has now lost its former significance. Currently, it is mostly used in electronics production or for some unique jewelry.')

ELECTRONICS = ('Electronic goods have firmly entered our lives and are necessary in all corners of the Sirius sector. Without complex electronic devices, ship systems, stations, and much more cannot function, and ordinary people can no longer lead daily lives without compact personal computers. At the same time, electronic devices are quite complex, so they cannot always be repaired, and therefore they will always remain popular with consumers.')

They cannot stop and rest, as gas is always around them, and it is unlikely to diminish. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize base downtime, and for this, high-quality licensed parts are needed.')
RED_ROID = ('Red ore contains strange metallic compounds, with which vast quantities of special red alloy can be very easily produced. There are opinions that red ore was invented by the Nomads to produce their giant objects. The Spanish also noted this feature of red ore. That is why there are so many huge stations in Corsair territory.')
ALLOY_RED = ('The main feature of red alloy is the ease of its manufacture. Therefore, it was produced in huge quantities in Corsair territory. This is why the Corsairs have so many giant stations. Also, Corsair spaceships are made from red alloy. The disadvantages of red alloy include brittleness in small structures. This is precisely why Corsair ships have a strong hull, but the armor of their components leaves much to be desired.')

Scientists of all nations are highly interested in obtaining this ore to continue work on developing cloaking devices.')

Cardamine addicts need it like air, especially in the later stages of addiction. For this reason, even in the inner colonies, there is huge demand for this drug. Distribution of such goods is prohibited by law, so it is not recommended to be caught by police with such cargo in the hold.')
