Cloaking device is already in your cargo hold.

Make sure to equip it as your countermeasure device.



[Инфо - зона невидимости:096404]
You are entering a high danger zone. Infiltrate The Sphere, avoiding the security line. The entrance to The Sphere is guarded by [b]Rheinland patrols equipped with cloaking detectors[/b]. Do not get caught. Additionally, there are several outposts located around the perimeter which can also locate you even when cloked - be careful.

[b]Cloaking detectors[/b]

When your are dangerously close to a detector, your ship will sound an alarm. If this happens, you must immediately leave the area or else the mission will be failed.

[b]Too difficult? Wish to decrease difficulty?[/b]

Navigate to an object called [b]Decrease mission difficulty[/b] and follow the instructions. You may also turn on your navigator, which will reveal useful hints.



[Инфо - выключить невидимость:096405]
In order to enter combat, you will need to turn off your cloaking device.

Assign a secondary key combination for [b]TRACTOR BEAM (all) / CLOAK ON[/b]. This combination must contain Ctrl, e.g. Ctrl+S. This will allow you to turn the cloak off.

The enemy has deployed telescopes along the perimeter. To distract nearby enemy patrols, hit the telescope. Note: you do not need to uncloak before doing so.

You will find a generator beneath a small hall under The Seed. Eliminate the generator to release a powerful energy beam that will damage The Seed and the ships guarding it.

[b]Warning![/b] The energy beam may easily destroy your ship, so you must leave the area immediately.

[b]Warning![/b] Infiltrate the lower hall. If you are discovered by the Nomads, they will attack at once and the entrance to the lower hall will be sealed.

There are control panels located on the mini-bases which are operated by the scientist and his assistant. Destroy them in order to seal their docking bays. Hacking guns and CSV mining devics will facilitate this process.

Your sabotage may trigger a lockdown. Nonetheless, the scientist and his assistant will attempt to escape the core via the main tunnel. Plan your actions so that they won't escape successfully.

Science ship scanners are not very efficient. Keep your distance and you should be able to move freely around the core without being detected.
