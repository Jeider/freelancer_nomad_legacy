[Courier jobs]

[center][b]Legal cargo delivery jobs[/b][/center]

Courier jobs are one-time jobs where you have to take the cargo objective to a specified destination.

[b]How to activate a job[/b]
1. Land on a base and install a trading license into your special slot.
2. Launch to space and select the job you want to activate.
3. Shoot the down the barrel with the job you want using your trading license as ammo (you'll see a special effect)
4. Make another shot with any cannon on the same barrel and you'll get the cargo for the delivery.
5. Sell the specified cargo at the target base. You'll have to sell the cargo to a local merchant of the target base.

[b][color=#990000]Beware![/color][/b]
1. Courier jobs can be activated only once. It is very important to have enough free space in the cargo hold (25 units). If you activated a job and were unable to pick up the cargo, you won't be able to retry it. For this reason, it's better to use cargo ships for these jobs, or at least land on a base to create an autosave.
2. All the pirates will be highly interested to rob you of your cargo. That's why, even if you are not hostile with pirates, it's still better to avoid them.
3. If you don't know the exact coordinates of job's destination, you can ask for them at the nearest station. The residents will tell you the exact location for a small fee.
4. All jobs have a time limit. If you fail or forget to deliver the cargo in time it will "spoil" and disappear from your cargo.
5. For the activation of different trading jobs you'll need different licenses. In the description of the courier job you'll see what type of license it will require. Please make sure beforehand, that your license-gun matches the license needed for the courier job.

[Zone: Large Asteroids]
Large asteroids can be mined for great amounts of ore, as well as valuable mass optimizers for your ship.

Ore can be mined using special mining guns. Any mining gun is suitable for this. If you don’t have one, you can buy a mining gun at the nearest mining vessel.

The most efficient way of mining ore is by using a Heavy Drill or a Ship Manipulator CSV.

Each asteroid has 3 weak points from which you can can extract resources. Shoot the asteroid to detect these points. If you hear a characteristic sound and asteroid started losing chunks, then you found one of the weak points. Continue shooting it and you will be rewarded.

Not all asteroids have the same value. You can find asteroids with highest value by using a special Marker Gun.

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] Asteroids in this zone are non-renewable. If you extracted all the resources from an asteroid, when you revisit the asteroid later, you [b]won’t get resources again[/b].


[Zone: Dense Gas]
Special automatic installations collect dense gas, so that the resulting clouds might regularly yield cylinders with liquefied gas.

Gas can be mined using special mining guns. Any mining gun is suitable for this. If you don’t have one, you can buy a mining gun at the nearest gas mining station.

The most efficient way of mining gas is by using a Gas Liquefying Gun or a Ship Manipulator CSV.

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] This zone is [b]renewable[/b]. You can mine more gas on your next visit.



[Zone: Large Ice Asteroids]
Large ice asteroids contain especially valuable and dense gases. You can get from them not only a large amount of liquefied gas, but also very valuable speed optimizers for your ship.

Large ice asteroids can be mined using special mining guns. Any mining gun is suitable for this. If you don’t have one, you can buy a mining gun at the nearest station.

The most efficient way of mining gas is by using a Gas Liquefying Gun or a Ship Manipulator CSV.

To get to the precious gases you will have to destroy ice asteroids with your mining gun. Most valueable dense gas clouds are hidden inside those ice asteroids.

Not all gas clouds in the asteroids have the same value. You can find ice asteroids with highest value by using a special Marker Gun.

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] Gas clouds in this zone are non-renewable. If you extracted all the resources from a gas cloud, when you revisit the gas cloud later, you [b]won’t get resources again[/b].


[Garbage Smelter]
Using ships in the radioactive zone isn't very smart, therefore garbage collection is mostly done by automatic smelters. Special unmanned garbage collection vessels deliver the collected garbage to the smelters, and the smelters merge the garbage into large garbage blocks. Later these blocks are delivered to stations in bulk for further analysis and final recycling of the remaining resources.


[Zone: Radioactive garbage]
The radioactive garbage collected by the smelters still contains a large amount of useful resources. It might contain not only scrap metal, but also extremely useful power optimizers for your ship.

Radioactive garbage can be mined using special mining guns. Any mining gun is suitable for this. If you don’t have one, you can buy a mining gun at the nearest station.

The most efficient way of mining radioactive garbage is by using a Garbage gun or a Ship Manipulator CSV.

To get the most useful resources from one smelter, you have to destroy all the garbage blocks that are on it.

Not all smelters contain the same value of garbage. You can find smelters with highest value by using a special Marker Gun. Please note, that the Marker Gun calculates the entire value for all garbage blocks on the platform. 

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] Garbage blocks in this zone are non-renewable. If you extracted all the resources from garbage blocks, when you revisit the smelter later, you [b]won’t get resources again[/b].


[Zone: Space Debree]
Destroyed spaceships, abandoned stations and other derelicts might contain many secrets. Of course, scavengers have long gotten to the most valuable places outside the object, but they obviously did not get inside yet. Find and hack special control panels on the object to open hidden bays containing treasures. Bear in mind that you will have to hack treasure containers to get to their content.

To hack a station you will need a special gun. You won't be able to hack control panels with a regular mining gun. Before buying a mining gun, check whether it has a hacking function. You can buy a hacking gun at any base in this system.

The most efficient way of hacking is by using an Hacking Gun or a Ship Manipulator CSV.

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] The contents of treasure containers are not renewable. If you extracted the treasures, when you revisit them later, you [b]won’t get resources again[/b].



[Shipwreck]
The pilot of this ship was a bit unlucky, may his soul rest in peace. This ship still has some value though. Shoot the ship to get what's left of it, just try not to damage it's external equipment, otherwise there will be nothing to take!

[b][color=#990000]Warning![/color][/b] Shipwrecks are not renewable! If you already extracted the equipment from a shipwreck, you [b]won’t get it again[/b] if you revisit it later.
