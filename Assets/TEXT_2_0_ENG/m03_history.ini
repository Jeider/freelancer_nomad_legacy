*DIALOGS
093801
NAME
*Wilhelm:\nHerr Trent, we need your services again. We'll discuss the details on Starke station in the Sigma-8 system. Wilhelm
093802
NAME
*Reichmann:\nIs everyone here? Let's begin
093803
NAME
*Reichmann:\nI'll recap the situation. The station's main mean of defense is its energy shield, divided into two hemispheres. 
093804
NAME
*Reichmann:\nThe shield is able to withstand too many direct hits from our battleships' weapons. Its weakness is a prolonged charge period.
093805
NAME
*Reichmann:\nAfter it's fully charged, it gives them enough time to completely obliterate our fleet. 
093806
NAME
*Reichmann:\nTo neutralize the shield, two mobile strike teams were formed under the command of Hassler and Greave. One will destroy the generators of the upper hemisphere, and the other – the lower.  
093807
NAME
*Reichmann:\nThese teams will have to advance to their destination through an anomaly that will be activated by Herr Hassler's ship. That'll be all. Let's go!
093808
NAME
*Hassler:\nPunishers, this is Punisher-1; activating the anomaly.
093809
NAME
*Hassler:\nGet in.
093810
NAME
*Hassler:\nAttention! I'm reading Corsair ships! Enter battle formation!
093811
NAME
*Hassler:\nThe station's generators started charging the shields! Ourtask–destroy the generators before they're fully charged! I repeat–our main goal is the generators!
093812
NAME
*Hassler:\nThe upper hemisphere's generators are down!
093813
NAME
*Hassler:\nMarauder-1, this is Punisher-1, we'll cover your fire!!!I repeat, the Punisher wing is covering your fire!
093814
NAME
*Greave:\nWe can't destroy the generators! We're up against... chhhhhhhh
093815
NAME
*Hassler:\nTower, this is Punisher-1, the entire Marauder wing is down. We're proceeding to destroy the lower hemisphere's generators.
093816
NAME
*Reichmann:\nRoger that, Punisher-1.
093817
NAME
*Dietrich:\nPunisher, Marauder, such fancy call signs! Such a shame I'll have to destroy you. Marauder is done. Punisher – it's your turn.
093818
NAME
*Hassler:\nTo hell with you, traitor! You'll break your teeth trying to bite us.
093819
NAME
*Dietrich:\nWho's that? Hassler? Stop serving this rotten, corrupted government! Come join the true patriots of Rheinland! Surrender, and I'll spare the life of you and your people.
093820
NAME
*Hassler:\nYou better hold on to yours instead!
093821
NAME
*Hassler:\nThis is Punisher-1! Lower hemisphere generators destroyed! I repeat, the shield generators are destroyed!
093822
NAME
*Reichmann:\nRoger that, Punisher-1. We'll begin our attack on the base.
093823
NAME
*Trent:\nHassler, what IS that? A few scratches take nine hours!
093824
NAME
*Hassler:\nOh, hell. Tower, this is Punisher-1. It seems like Dietrich is fleeing away with a small escort!
093825
NAME
*Reichmann:\nPunisher-1, stop them at all costs!!!
093826
NAME
*Hassler:\nPunishers, battle formation! Our goal – a group of departing ships with a transport ahead of the formation.
093827
NAME
*Hassler:\nDestroy the hostile ships!
093828
NAME
*Trent:\nThe transport's leaving.
093829
NAME
*Hassler:\nWe'll deal with him later.
093830
NAME
*Reichmann:\nThis is Admiral Reichmann. The station is destroyed. Well done everyone. Hassler, status report.
093831
NAME
*Hassler:\nDietrich and his squad are destroyed. One transport has managed to escape.
093834
NAME
*Reichmann:\nHASSLER, YOU SON OF A-!!! How could you allow this??? Find that transport and destroy it immediately!!!
093835
NAME
*Hassler:\nPunishers, follow me.
093836
NAME
*Trent:\nThat's a jump gate. There are so many ships passing by every day, we can't keep track of them.
093837
NAME
*Hassler:\nWe'll head to the rogue base, Vigo. Maybe they'll know something...
093860
NAME
*Hassler:\nWe're heading to the rendezvous point. The coordinates are already on your HUD, Herr Trent.
093861
NAME
*Wilhelm:\nI've informed Admiral Reichmann that we're on the way. He'll begin the mission's briefing.
093862

093863

*Wilhelm:\nNow… (presses a button) ready, listen. 
093864
NAME
*Hassler:\nEverything clear, people? Moving in.  
093865
NAME
*Greave:\nAnomaly up ahead. Judging by the scanners, it's still active. 
093866
NAME
*Hassler:\nRoger, start preparing the device.
093867
NAME
*Hassler:\nПриступаю к активации... (unused)

093871
NAME
*Hassler:\nWe've reached the waypoint. Marauder, take care of the lower hemisphere. Punishers, follow me to the upper hemisphere. (unused?)
093872
NAME
*Greave:\nRoger that, Punisher-1.
093873
NAME
*Hassler:\nВижу корабли противника. Герр Трент, сконцентрируйте огонь на генераторах. Истребители не ваша забота. (unused)
093874

*Wilhelm:\nThe fleet is here. Punishers, clear all remaining hostile ships in the area. 
093875

*Hassler:\nThis is Punisher-1, loud and clear. 
093876
NAME
*Hassler:\nThe shield is down. Punishers, move closer to the base.
093877
NAME
*Punisher-2:\nThe heat trail leads to an unknown jump gate and breaks off. 
093878
NAME
*Hassler:\nWe'll follow in. Maybe we can still catch up.
093879
NAME
*Punisher-2:\nDietrich turned some kind of additional shield on, he's now invulnerable to all attacks! 
093880
NAME
*Hassler:\nKeep firing, he won't be able to hold on for much longer.
