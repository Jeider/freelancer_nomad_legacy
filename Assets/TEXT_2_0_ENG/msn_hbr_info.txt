[b]Mission briefing[/b]
The IRA forces appeared to be prepared for prolonged defense. They've deployed a powerful force field around their planet, preventing our ships from landing and defending their planet from being destroyed by the Triumph cannon. 

We need your help. Dock with Battleship Orion and install the special charger. With the help of this charger, we can overcharge the Triumph cannon, and finally destroy the IRA base!

Unfortunately, we can’t provide you with enough ammo to fully charge all of the Triumph cannon’s generators. You can find additional charger gun ammo at various points in the Tau-81 system, such as:
- friendly repair shipyards;
- hostile solar power plants;
- hostile asteroid bases.

You can get more info on these objects in the bar aboard Battleship Orion.

[b]How to charge the Triumph cannon[/b]
To charge the Triumph cannon, you need to shoot the generators attached to it. These generators will be marked in your target list. Be careful–your charger gun’s ammo is limited! If you miss too many shots, you won’t have enough left to fully charge the Triumph cannon!

Charging one generator requires 15 direct hits from the charger gun.

[b]How to start the mission[/b]
To start the mission, you need to activate the Tau-81 Jump Gate. 

You can only dock with it if you have a pre-loaded charger gun installed.

[b]How to get the reward[/b]
After destroying the planet, its debris and the hostile base’s debris will remain. Your reward will be in the base’s debris. The debris containing the reward will be marked with a special orange marker. Shoot the marked debris to get your reward.

Welcome! You have selected the «Operation Waterloo» quest.

This quest can be run in ordinary Sirius. The only differences are that you can’t change your ship’s loadout, nor can you leave this system, because the gates are blocked.

[b]How to play the mission[/b]

The rules are quite simple. You have a special [b]Charger Gun[/b]. Fly to the [b]Triumph Cannon[/b] and shoot at the marked generators using your Charger Gun. The generators will be charged after 15 hits.

The ammo of your Charger Gun is limited, so use it [b]very carefully[/b]. You can replenish ammo both at hostile and friendly stations. You can find them using the patrol map. For instance, fly to the nearest shipyard. You’ll notice there are ammo containers nearby. To get ammo, you must destroy these containers. It’s not recommended to destroy them before you actually need the ammo. Try to approach them only when your Charger Gun’s ammo is depleted.

To complete the mission, you need to charge all of the Triumph Cannon’s generators. Shoot the generators, replenish your ammo, and in the end – the cannon will destroy the planet.

[b]Additional features[/b]

Tip: There’s an informant near you. You can always see the mission’s description in its infocard.

Repair Zones:You’re no longer limited to repairs by nanobots. There’s a repair zone at the shipyard near you. Just fly into it to repair your ship.
